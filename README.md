For centuries, cartographers have wrestled with the challenges of making accurate maps.
They were limited by not only the mathematical impossibility of accurately portraying a
cured surface on a plane, but also by their own computational limitations. In Mercator's
day, creating a single conformal cyllindrical map required performing a Riemann sum for
every single latitude. Even today, some of the most mathematically complex map
projections cling to simple geometric shapes, like the straight lines of Tobler or the
tetrahedrons of AuthaGraph. Modern cartographers work to minimise distortion and
constrain it to the least important regions of the globe -- usually the oceans -- within
the constraints of these basic formulae.

And yet, this is the twenty-first century. The Mayan apocalypse has come and gone. The
singularity is nigh on the horizon. Cartographers need not bow to these computational
constraints any longer. The time has come to shake free of these arbitrary lines of
latitude and longitude, to throw off these circles and hyperellipses and power
functions, to deny control over our maps to these unchallenged assumptions that physical
area is the most important quantity of a country, that Antarctica is unimportant and
negligible, that the International Dateline is the end of the world! The time has come
for the Catōji projections (ooh, look at that stylistic ⟨C⟩!).

The Catōji projections are the optimal map projections, in the most literal sense of the
word. Each one is represented by a fine mesh of vertices that represent an elastic
spherical surface. That surface is allowed to come to rest, thus reducing the distortions
of size and shape throughout the mesh. The core of the Catōji projection's strength
comes from the fact that it _has no equations_. It is free to be anything or anyone,
regardless of how ungeometrical or irregular that may be. This family of maps can be
easily adapted and applied to any function. Comparing areas? Showing statistics?
Teaching children? There's a Catōji projection for you!
